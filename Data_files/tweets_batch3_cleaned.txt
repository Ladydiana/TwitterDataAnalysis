@pewdiepie Vox when they'll make a post about this https://t.co/no2e6TAJvE
@vedia_lupae @ZeeZeeMooMoo I like how everyone blaming Pewdiepie is literally an SJW stereotype. Way to be quirky and unique Furry Overly Sensitive LGBT SJW #3927111. No wonder all of you can't process logical thinking.
@pewdiepie lol you know most of us aren't Korean army right pewds?

@pewdiepie No Korean please
@arabbitorduck @HeartsTM @RubinReport @pewdiepie @benshapiro @Barnes_Law i answered you 10 times
@RubinReport @Barnes_Law He also had a tweet about advocating to punch pewdiepie fans and a picture of someone punching that white supremacist guy in the face that happend some years ago. Spenser?
@RakeshK28825941 @subgap (2/2) you don't see Pewdiepie saying "Subscribe to make Sweden proud" do you?
@pewdiepie So when are we gonna get the btsüëèreviewüëè lmao who knows they might follow Felix back
@HeartsTM @Jameskies @JoelLundqvist4 @RubinReport @pewdiepie @benshapiro I just wish he'd either shit or get off the pot at this point. Either offer some evidence or just go troll elsewhere.
@epipeny @pewdiepie he will do it i feel it in my left tiddy
@arabbitorduck @JoelLundqvist4 @HeartsTM @RubinReport @pewdiepie @benshapiro you are splitting hairs. virtually no one and not even a majority are far from the same thing. you are bending over backwards and its embarrassing
Pewdiepie is actually a good name cause it‚Äôs like cutiepie but replaced with a gun shot in the beginning
@pewdiepie https://t.co/5wJlVtCbX4 react plz
@pewdiepie We're asking BTS ARMY for help? These are some very tough times.
@AthooThePro @_heartpiercer_ @YuzuZoro @karentookmykid @pewdiepie 7 
There‚Äôs 7
@RakeshK28825941 @subgap T-series is using nationalism and quantity over quality to win. Pewdiepie is supported by his fanbase and by quality content. How is a youtube channel in any way connected to a country? It's not, except T-series acts like it is, by saying that it will 'make India proud' (1/2)
@AthooThePro @Durg_Dealer @YuzuZoro @karentookmykid @pewdiepie yet everyone blows up about it. I‚Äôm more mad at the fact that people think that people racist to people of the African descendant or western culture is not okay but being racist to everyone else is fine.

@pknouns PK Pewdiepie will win
@Jameskies @JoelLundqvist4 @HeartsTM @RubinReport @pewdiepie @benshapiro I must have missed in the now 7 times I've asked you to provide evidence to back the assertion that he's lied for money where you actually provided anything remotely close to that.
My new favorite thing is to just say PewDiePie is racist and then not respond to the namesearching sad ass kids running into my mentions to defend him when they expect me to debate them

@petercoffin It seems like there's some major crisis containment at youtube right now. the search filters are disabled probably because they don't want people using their platform to distribute the live stream. when I searched for christchurch + pewdiepie, the last video I see is 3 days old
@pewdiepie Pewdiepie weeaboo confirmed
@jkass99 "It was just chalk" "it was repaired"

@nopeifyaltalt @pewdiepie That just like some advanced maths.
@Jameskies @JoelLundqvist4 @HeartsTM @RubinReport @pewdiepie @benshapiro No, Rubin is said to have claimed (by your own source) "There's virtually no one on the right that cares about gay marriage anymore."

Your claim that he said "nobody is against gay marriage" is what we'd call a "lie." 7th time's a charm: Provide evidence of lies for money.

@Hilariususrname @pewdiepie He says, "I thought I would turn him into the least cute thing I could think of." This isn't some offhand comment, he says it as his opening premise, almost as a thesis for the joke to come.
Pewdiepie is a racist. His fans are terrorists.

@Hilariususrname @pewdiepie My situation was entirely hypothetical, I don't even want to interact with someone who thinks that way. Your claim about "ironic fascism" not easily provable, and I doubt it's validity. Not to mention that Count clearly expresses his intent in the first 10 seconds of the video
@4CarlosCardoso @NateTalksToYou No one ever said he did. However, he routinely made jokes based on edgy fascism to the point where someone's made videos titled "Pewdiepie Redpill Compilation #1" and he follows these people. Obviously, some amount of his fans will think he supports the far right and do the same

@AthooThePro @Durg_Dealer @YuzuZoro @karentookmykid @pewdiepie just search up Ching Chong online and you will literally see that it‚Äôs a racial slur to asians and making fun of how asian American speak
@namjoonspigeons @MrFailcake @TheQuartering @pewdiepie Woooosh
@pewdiepie There's so many people on twitter not even looking into facts. They are saying that Pewdiepie inspired this act of terrorism because of the T-Series vs Pewdiepie agenda. As if he was terrorising a mosque in the name of subscribing to pewdiepie. The shooter wanted  civil war.

@TeraBriteGames @pewdiepie TODAY I WAS ON SCHOOL AND ME AND MY FRIENDS  WERE SEEING @pewdiepie VS @TSeries AND LIKE NOTHING T SERIES HA 6K SUBS MORE THAN PEW  AND LIKE ME AND MY FRIENDS WERE SHOCK, THEY USE BOTS T-BOT, seriously we saw that epic moment that tseries used bots that was insane @TeraBriteGames
@garbotoxins @nathanTbernard so there is no point pulling it out... everyone call Pewdiepie Nazi so pulling out as you called him Fascist ( even tho i doubt you know what it means) is pointless, the fact he is following him and used him in context of memes is totally irrelevant to the "scandal'
@Thesixler I'm not searching keywords. I genuinely have followed you for years through Harmontown. I'm organically seeing your tweet to argue that these statements about pewdiepie are laughable. When conspiracy theory is so prevalent it sounds real. Its mass hysteria.
@SyntacYT I don't watch pewdiepie or find him funny at all, but that shouldn't be a reason for you to unfollow Syntac. He's great and been trying to catch up with his S4 the Island its soooooo much but very intresting.
@arabbitorduck @JoelLundqvist4 @HeartsTM @RubinReport @pewdiepie @benshapiro then your meter for detecting propaganda is fucking broken. being adversarial to power is the opposite of propaganda. also you keep changing your question. i gave you a link of someone running down some falsehoods and lies.

@Jameskies @HeartsTM @RubinReport @pewdiepie @benshapiro @Barnes_Law No, again, "actori incumbit onus probandi" -- you make the accusation, it's your *obligation* to provide all necessary evidence to back it up.

Fifth time: point to specific examples of Dave Rubin lying for money as you've claimed previously.

- Consider the numbers between the two. There are clearly going to be people that are subscribed to both channels and still be like Subscribe to Pewdiepie. Piss off you hypocrite. If this is such a big deal to you, unsubscribe from T Series. Twats.
I am in a ranty mood today. So let's go on about why I don't give a flying fuck about this Pewdiepie and T Series shit. 
- Before long, one of them is going to crash and burn. Whether it be something uploaded, something said, etc, this cancel culture shit will take place.
@Imran1759 @RubinReport @pewdiepie @benshapiro The fact is is NOT A PROBLEM. That's what the BLOCK button is for!

@arabbitorduck @JoelLundqvist4 @HeartsTM @RubinReport @pewdiepie @benshapiro it is the medias job to report the truth and remain adversarial to power, even if that means taking a side. neutrality is not a good thing, especially if the person you are interviewing says particularly horrible things
