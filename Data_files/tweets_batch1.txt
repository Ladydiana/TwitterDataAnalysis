@Fishadilla1 @Quesodude @pewdiepie ok buddy
If you blame PewDiePie for the mass shooting, you are truly stupid. The gunman was a disturbed person, you can't blame an online personality for this. This must be heartbreaking for PewDiePie, to be slandered in such a despicable manner. He has never condoned such behavior
@VidCon Stop demonitizing Lord @pewdiepie
@MrBeastYT @sea1997isgay I SUBSCRIBED TO PEWDIEPIE, I DESERVE IT BEAST

@pewdiepie WHAT?! HOW https://t.co/vqELmhDc2J
@developerooze @Bonzane1 @V8W2Y2 @James_Elmquist @YouTube @pewdiepie He said that he ignored the fact that racist group's watch him and take everything he said as real 
Since then he continually distanced himself, saying he doesn't like or want to promote any kind of behavior like that

Hope if you see it that you like it because this is the longest amount of time I have ever spent on a video
the REAL tea is his stans are absolutely ride or die for the pewdiepie who made funny let's plays and will find any way possible for forgiving him for continuously fucking up and the rest of the commentary community rides his dick all day long to leech off his fame. grow a spine.
@TroyBrophy @AstralikaCastle @Hbomberguy Troy, pewdiepie has 89,000,000 subscribers on YouTube. That's a mind boggling audience. He has more people watching his videos than there are people living in Texas. Three Texas, even.
@JeremyClarkson  have you subscribed to #pewdiepie
hey @pewdiepie and @ArianaGrande unfollow shane dawson pls
@StevenOnStuff @notaxation @pewdiepie Yeah, because Felix was the one that pulled a gun on a mosque and killed a number of people.

Yeah, no.

Your logic is equivalent to ‚ÄúIf I yell Chris Pratt‚Äôs name while shooting up a mall, it‚Äôs his fault.‚Äù 

Take some time and think about what you tweeted.
@Reporte48824072 @Boogie2988 @pewdiepie these things are standard though and liberals in the west have a bigotry or low expectations for the people who commit these vile acts, so naturally they don't care.
@stareivia That horrible pewdiepie follows the leader of the alt right laci green! Burn it down! https://t.co/2ARiv0Lopa
I love how people are still blaming pewdiepie for shit he did years a go that he apologized for. Its not like people change or anything
@louisymptoms @thenorwegian76 @smolpoods @pewdiepie Did you just ‚ÄùHe who smelt it dealt it‚Äù Neo-Nazism?
@doggo_josh @KaiaSonderby you actually sound ridiculous when you talk about destroying the world through a culture war just because people critique PewDiePie. He's not that important. At the end of the day he's a YouTuber. Him making or not making content is not going to change anything.
@nivrap_nobody @Hbomberguy @ContraPoints And you constantly, incessantly, refusing to acknowledge that his use of the meme before a fucking shooting that left 50 people dead isn't indicative of a dangerous culture and instead replying with "Pewdiepie didnt do it" is kind of proving his point.

@clamorousvoice @pewdiepie Which school?
@elenoreeeeeeee @EmioFog @smolpoods @pewdiepie I still can‚Äôt believe that people actually think that the Terrorist was trying to start fucking YouTube drama and not, idk, ignite a new crusade against Islam

The World is bigger than Youtube.
@TrevorWHarrison @pewdiepie Donating may help but it doesn't stop polatics n socail media going at him. Monney n drama talks Trevor too bad you will never understand
Also PewDiePie runs a news channel for fucks sake of course he's gonna follow people he doesn't necessarily endorse

Why do the mass media exist? Can we just burn the press? Like the stretches they‚Äôll go to ‚ÄúPewdiepie is actually a white supremacist Nazi with and evil circle of pedophiles who rape starving African children, here‚Äôs the proof he did the üëåüèª sign‚Äù

this shit is SO annoying!! i cant understand how anyone can laugh at some bland ass straight white guy being a bigot. he's not funny he's just a fucking idiot. if there are BRILLIANT comedians who don't have to rely on being edgy to be funny, pewdiepie can do the same
What if we call out Pewdiepie for all of that stuff, then call out Hbomb for all of the same stuff minus the nazism, plus being a pompous little bitch? https://t.co/8LAHmgcu54
It hasn't even been a week since the attack and journalists are going out of their way to not only play into the psycho's hands, but blame Pewdiepie for something he had nothing to do with. 

And they think themselves to be good people. "Thank a journalist". No.

@dingerdanger @Sublime0126 @Flusswoelfin @EricDSnider If you watched a pewdiepie video and got white supremavist racist vibe from him then you're the problem. Thats not Felix at all. And saying things like that on the internet creates a dangerous precedent for actual violent people blaming their mistakes on innocent people. Not ok.
@JacobyIsMyName @pewdiepie I'm the farthest thing from being a fan of his, but why would people think HE is personally responsible for this tragedy? What????
@Bonzane1 @V8W2Y2 @James_Elmquist @YouTube @pewdiepie (6)
And that kind of behavior is unacceptable and rightfully so.
The "subscribe to PewDiePie". Same situation. Knowing that alt-right guys in the U.S have previously tried to frame PewDiePie as their own he says it and thus make people believe PewDiePie is an alt-right guy. Stirs shit up.
it happened :( @pewdiepie https://t.co/nXswqx3GYJ
Could you imagine people who starting watching pewdiepie now being shocked that he plays games üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüíî
@xFatih @grantstern @pewdiepie Considering he casually used racist rhetoric,  seriously or not, does play a part in this, and I'm hoping this is a wake up call to him to not treat that subject matter lightly.
@L1rian @downsinjerome @Lapinsky_11 @pewdiepie Oh, was he kidding?  Hard to tell in a tweet tbh.
Pewdiepie throws his head back when he laughs. It's cute.
@YoungNubian @tariqnasheed @KingofNoStrings thats because the symbol he is doing is not racist, its the context behind it, pewdiepie did that ok symbol as a reaction for people to meme or use as a reaction to something that was good, he also did this finger wagging one, is he racist is this also becomes a wp gesture? https://t.co/WKrLLoDaLb

@Lapinsky_11 @pewdiepie He misquoted/-used the article. That part of the article was about the hacking. Hacking in itself is not illegal but can easily be used as an illegal tool, that's why him endorsing hacking is interpretable as condoning extreme activity and was likely a fuel to these vandalizers.

@JViscoNJ @jkass99 why do Nazis write "Subscribe to PewdiePie" on Holocaust Memorials?

Can you explain why that happens? If it happens so often, so repeatedly, is it random? 

People know it's not random
@ahlatkhan9 the police were just memeing. And the shooter was a memer it seems as well as he mentioned pewdiepie and did the symbol. That man deserves to burn in hell
@pewdiepie im a New Zealander and was very close to where the attack happened, this is not something we even thought could happen in NZ, we are so disturbed. NZ is such a welcoming country to every culture..regardless we do not blame you Felix. This is not your fault. The terrorist is sick!
I've never watched a spankiev or PewDiePie video before strangely
Two things I want to address. Get over it the shooter wanted to give pewdiepie a bad image. Second of all care more about the victims and family from the tradedgy #PewdiepieDidNothingWrong
@GossiTheDog I ONLY commented on the "not always said in hate"...which I told you to hop online. Pewdiepie said something horrible (not to the person btw) but to his stream. Said he was sorry and erases the video. I never said why he said it. I don't know. YOU DON'T KNOW.
I wonder how many of Pewdiepie‚Äôs subscribers are dead
Fun video (with @pewdiepie, @atmosgames) and a cool game! I popped into some of the development streams, but never saw the full thing until now. Great work @atmosgames (in such a short time, too)! :)

Why people hating on PewDiePie. His haters come out from caves for any hit he gets.
@DaxOrien @MavrelousMavrel @Undoomed @pewdiepie I never said it fell flat on me
