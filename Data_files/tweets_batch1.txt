@tariqnasheed First off I believe in equal right and second this is insane man. It wasn‚Äôt pewdiepie fault that this man was insane
@MiesterIzi @pewdiepie But he lives in Italy. However, it's unlikely that he forgot his own language!

@joesanders33 @EricRWeinstein @ChelseaClinton @pewdiepie @RealCandaceO @benshapiro @SamHarrisOrg @Ayaan they can be known but they‚Äôre not household names people wildly don‚Äôt know any of them only the attack which is what this guy wanted. this guys the living embodiment of poo in a toilet so it doesn‚Äôt matter his ideals have been read and no one agrees except Bernie sanders
@ProductsIndian @TSeries @praveendel @pewdiepie @amazonIN aaayyyyw this grandpa got butthurt when pewdiepie said bitch lasagna lol
@ElxBatman @pewdiepie A guy shot up a building on Facebook live and pewdiepie is getting shit because the guy said ‚Äúsub to pewdiepie‚Äù before going in.
_Trin_Fan @zavareh_tina @Tweets_of_Sarah @UKIP @GerardBattenMEP @DailyMirror @pewdiepie I can give you the names of 50 people, all hanged by UK courts just between 1800 and 1835 alone, for being gay.. We decriminalised only 50 years ago. It is not so long ago as to be claiming any higher moral ground.
@pewdiepie Hi @pewdiepie: dedicate platform and $$$ to kill hate. You can still have fun and your followers can too. Disavow haters unequivocally &amp;donate large sums to Muslim/Jewish/diversity-positive groups.  Advertisers will love it! &amp;youíll be a force for GOOD (Son loves u btw) https://t.co/xKZxxOV9dy
@hijakejohnstone @pewdiepie @RealCandaceO Hey sweetie did you know he went to China and visited in vicinity of where China has those awful camps of theirs. He liked China.
@h_asvalt @pewdiepie I know @h_asvalt I wish I could down vote. I wanted to know what happened with Pewds
@subgap @GamerDat1 @pewdiepie @Jack_Septic_Eye @h3h3productions Oh fuck
@JordanMalicious @pewdiepie Oh ffs.
@ProductsIndian @itsBhushanKumar @pewdiepie @TSeries Just let it go boys, this person clearly doesnt know how to read nor knows the full stories. Just let his ignorance blind him.
@itsangaria @xnahc @pewdiepie @CCNMarkets Pewds company vs a 30 year old company from India lmao
@MiesterIzi @pewdiepie Okay! I think he'll listen to me, this time!
@kjellrad @pewdiepie Repeating something multiple times doesn't make it true. That said, this is true.
@StargazeMemoria Still need a pewdiepie chair, old men like us are breaking backs.
@JackPier6 @BishopMeme @StuartJones7 Pewdiepie could make 20 mil if he did more than make videos but i dont think he'll be borrowing money anytime soon
@HenrikJhnsn @epicmafiagamer @emillia_20 @Alley_Dream @Wiishu @pewdiepie Don't construe my words. I'm saying he must be careful about what he says. People interpret in different ways. I'm not blaming him for the attack obviously.
@ZeeZeeMooMoo Ok so just because I like videos from a man who said the n word on accident (@pewdiepie) means I'm racist right?
Affordable Reclining Ergonomic Gaming Racing Chair Just Like PewDiePie's https://t.co/KH5jBF6ImQ
@pewdiepie https://t.co/GlS5zijyuw this man has been tryin to get on meme review for 100 days
@_RebeccaParham In a year from today, you will pass pewdiepie
@Fishadilla1 @Quesodude @pewdiepie ok buddy
If you blame PewDiePie for the mass shooting, you are truly stupid. The gunman was a disturbed person, you can't blame an online personality for this. This must be heartbreaking for PewDiePie, to be slandered in such a despicable manner. He has never condoned such behavior
@VidCon Stop demonitizing Lord @pewdiepie
@MrBeastYT @sea1997isgay I SUBSCRIBED TO PEWDIEPIE, I DESERVE IT BEAST
I like that everything from emojis to new atheism, everyone from Chelsea Clinton to PewDiePie have been blamed for the NZ terror attacks but no one's even mentioning the taboo subjects that ACTUALLY made the guy commit this massacre: Islamic terrorism &amp; mass immigration
@pewdiepie WHAT?! HOW https://t.co/vqELmhDc2J
@developerooze @Bonzane1 @V8W2Y2 @James_Elmquist @YouTube @pewdiepie He said that he ignored the fact that racist group's watch him and take everything he said as real 
Since then he continually distanced himself, saying he doesn't like or want to promote any kind of behavior like that
@xJawz @JD_2020 @pewdiepie You can‚Äôt blame a psychopath‚Äôs actions on Shapiro. Ben didn‚Äôt fire the gun. Your logic is inane
@nivrap_nobody @Hbomberguy @ContraPoints inb4 the inevitable "Oh so you're saying pewdiepie's memes did it" and "Memes are just a normal thing they're not dangerous" wank that completely ignores everything I've said.
@iNabberTV @RiceeChrispies @ExtremeBlitx @SailorHeck @jakepaul @Campcastcontext @MLJoee PewDiePie beat T-Series haha
@rknight2401 @pewdiepie @YouTube Pedophile
@JeffreeStar Omg I thought Jeffrey was Pewdiepie for a second üòê
@iNabberTV @RiceeChrispies @ExtremeBlitx @SailorHeck @jakepaul @Campcastcontext @MLJoee Pewdiepie has beat t series
@xKingTMac The problem is. The dude was a fan of pewdiepie, and he left "sub to pewdiepie" on a forum right before he murdered all those people.

People are putting pewdiepie to blame when it isnt his fault
made bitch lasagna but in smash ultimate
https://t.co/isZEabces3
@pewdiepie
Hope if you see it that you like it because this is the longest amount of time I have ever spent on a video
the REAL tea is his stans are absolutely ride or die for the pewdiepie who made funny let's plays and will find any way possible for forgiving him for continuously fucking up and the rest of the commentary community rides his dick all day long to leech off his fame. grow a spine.
@TroyBrophy @AstralikaCastle @Hbomberguy Troy, pewdiepie has 89,000,000 subscribers on YouTube. That's a mind boggling audience. He has more people watching his videos than there are people living in Texas. Three Texas, even.
@JeremyClarkson  have you subscribed to #pewdiepie
hey @pewdiepie and @ArianaGrande unfollow shane dawson pls
@StevenOnStuff @notaxation @pewdiepie Yeah, because Felix was the one that pulled a gun on a mosque and killed a number of people.

Yeah, no.

Your logic is equivalent to ‚ÄúIf I yell Chris Pratt‚Äôs name while shooting up a mall, it‚Äôs his fault.‚Äù 

Take some time and think about what you tweeted.
@Reporte48824072 @Boogie2988 @pewdiepie these things are standard though and liberals in the west have a bigotry or low expectations for the people who commit these vile acts, so naturally they don't care.
@stareivia That horrible pewdiepie follows the leader of the alt right laci green! Burn it down! https://t.co/2ARiv0Lopa
I love how people are still blaming pewdiepie for shit he did years a go that he apologized for. Its not like people change or anything
@louisymptoms @thenorwegian76 @smolpoods @pewdiepie Did you just ‚ÄùHe who smelt it dealt it‚Äù Neo-Nazism?
@doggo_josh @KaiaSonderby you actually sound ridiculous when you talk about destroying the world through a culture war just because people critique PewDiePie. He's not that important. At the end of the day he's a YouTuber. Him making or not making content is not going to change anything.
@nivrap_nobody @Hbomberguy @ContraPoints And you constantly, incessantly, refusing to acknowledge that his use of the meme before a fucking shooting that left 50 people dead isn't indicative of a dangerous culture and instead replying with "Pewdiepie didnt do it" is kind of proving his point.
@pmeinertzhagen @pewdiepie Cheney
@KEEMSTAR PewDiePie subreddit getting banned any thoughts?
Hey @JTonYouTube me and another one of your fans went to the kraken clickbaiters channel and he‚Äôs doing a pewdiepie be t series live stream and he shut down live stream chat because we were calling him a clickbaiter
Positive newse? @pewdiepie https://t.co/A3Ss2U5z0Q
@pewdiepie honestly same
@Reporte48824072 @Boogie2988 @pewdiepie actually, because they were muslim, EVERYONE gives a shit. 120 christians were brutally murdered this week in muslim attacks but i bet you didn't even hear about that. same deal with with gaza launching more rockets at israel.
@ZeeZeeMooMoo @Quesodude @pewdiepie "complicit in"
remember that time pewdiepie uploaded a video telling people who go shoot up mosques
@clamorousvoice @pewdiepie Which school?
@elenoreeeeeeee @EmioFog @smolpoods @pewdiepie I still can‚Äôt believe that people actually think that the Terrorist was trying to start fucking YouTube drama and not, idk, ignite a new crusade against Islam

The World is bigger than Youtube.
@TrevorWHarrison @pewdiepie Donating may help but it doesn't stop polatics n socail media going at him. Monney n drama talks Trevor too bad you will never understand
Also PewDiePie runs a news channel for fucks sake of course he's gonna follow people he doesn't necessarily endorse
@VidCon @JackMasseyWelsh @Smajor1995 @Seapeekay @TheOrionSound @NovaSoBored @LaurenzSide @pewdiepie @KaiRossBest @WillzTheKing @LDShadowLady @Smallishbeans Oh and @JoeyGraceffa @theodd1sout @MrBeastYT @MatPatGT @MisterPreda
No one:

Far left article: Here's why PewDiePie is responsible for every instance of racial injustice in all of history
Why do the mass media exist? Can we just burn the press? Like the stretches they‚Äôll go to ‚ÄúPewdiepie is actually a white supremacist Nazi with and evil circle of pedophiles who rape starving African children, here‚Äôs the proof he did the üëåüèª sign‚Äù
@pewdiepie we asked you to UPgrade the quality
Wtf happend With pewdiepie
@kjellrad @pewdiepie I subscribed!
Where is the next target Sir?
this shit is SO annoying!! i cant understand how anyone can laugh at some bland ass straight white guy being a bigot. he's not funny he's just a fucking idiot. if there are BRILLIANT comedians who don't have to rely on being edgy to be funny, pewdiepie can do the same
What if we call out Pewdiepie for all of that stuff, then call out Hbomb for all of the same stuff minus the nazism, plus being a pompous little bitch? https://t.co/8LAHmgcu54
It hasn't even been a week since the attack and journalists are going out of their way to not only play into the psycho's hands, but blame Pewdiepie for something he had nothing to do with. 

And they think themselves to be good people. "Thank a journalist". No.

@dingerdanger @Sublime0126 @Flusswoelfin @EricDSnider If you watched a pewdiepie video and got white supremavist racist vibe from him then you're the problem. Thats not Felix at all. And saying things like that on the internet creates a dangerous precedent for actual violent people blaming their mistakes on innocent people. Not ok.
@JacobyIsMyName @pewdiepie I'm the farthest thing from being a fan of his, but why would people think HE is personally responsible for this tragedy? What????
@Bonzane1 @V8W2Y2 @James_Elmquist @YouTube @pewdiepie (6)
And that kind of behavior is unacceptable and rightfully so.
