@Fishadilla1 @Quesodude @pewdiepie ok buddy
If you blame PewDiePie for the mass shooting, you are truly stupid. The gunman was a disturbed person, you can't blame an online personality for this. This must be heartbreaking for PewDiePie, to be slandered in such a despicable manner. He has never condoned such behavior
@VidCon Stop demonitizing Lord @pewdiepie
@MrBeastYT @sea1997isgay I SUBSCRIBED TO PEWDIEPIE, I DESERVE IT BEAST

@pewdiepie WHAT?! HOW https://t.co/vqELmhDc2J
@developerooze @Bonzane1 @V8W2Y2 @James_Elmquist @YouTube @pewdiepie He said that he ignored the fact that racist group's watch him and take everything he said as real 
Since then he continually distanced himself, saying he doesn't like or want to promote any kind of behavior like that

Hope if you see it that you like it because this is the longest amount of time I have ever spent on a video
the REAL tea is his stans are absolutely ride or die for the pewdiepie who made funny let's plays and will find any way possible for forgiving him for continuously fucking up and the rest of the commentary community rides his dick all day long to leech off his fame. grow a spine.
@TroyBrophy @AstralikaCastle @Hbomberguy Troy, pewdiepie has 89,000,000 subscribers on YouTube. That's a mind boggling audience. He has more people watching his videos than there are people living in Texas. Three Texas, even.
@JeremyClarkson  have you subscribed to #pewdiepie
hey @pewdiepie and @ArianaGrande unfollow shane dawson pls
@StevenOnStuff @notaxation @pewdiepie Yeah, because Felix was the one that pulled a gun on a mosque and killed a number of people.

Yeah, no.

Your logic is equivalent to ‚ÄúIf I yell Chris Pratt‚Äôs name while shooting up a mall, it‚Äôs his fault.‚Äù 

Take some time and think about what you tweeted.
@Reporte48824072 @Boogie2988 @pewdiepie these things are standard though and liberals in the west have a bigotry or low expectations for the people who commit these vile acts, so naturally they don't care.
@stareivia That horrible pewdiepie follows the leader of the alt right laci green! Burn it down! https://t.co/2ARiv0Lopa
I love how people are still blaming pewdiepie for shit he did years a go that he apologized for. Its not like people change or anything
@louisymptoms @thenorwegian76 @smolpoods @pewdiepie Did you just ‚ÄùHe who smelt it dealt it‚Äù Neo-Nazism?
@doggo_josh @KaiaSonderby you actually sound ridiculous when you talk about destroying the world through a culture war just because people critique PewDiePie. He's not that important. At the end of the day he's a YouTuber. Him making or not making content is not going to change anything.
@nivrap_nobody @Hbomberguy @ContraPoints And you constantly, incessantly, refusing to acknowledge that his use of the meme before a fucking shooting that left 50 people dead isn't indicative of a dangerous culture and instead replying with "Pewdiepie didnt do it" is kind of proving his point.

@clamorousvoice @pewdiepie Which school?
@elenoreeeeeeee @EmioFog @smolpoods @pewdiepie I still can‚Äôt believe that people actually think that the Terrorist was trying to start fucking YouTube drama and not, idk, ignite a new crusade against Islam

The World is bigger than Youtube.
@TrevorWHarrison @pewdiepie Donating may help but it doesn't stop polatics n socail media going at him. Monney n drama talks Trevor too bad you will never understand
Also PewDiePie runs a news channel for fucks sake of course he's gonna follow people he doesn't necessarily endorse

Why do the mass media exist? Can we just burn the press? Like the stretches they‚Äôll go to ‚ÄúPewdiepie is actually a white supremacist Nazi with and evil circle of pedophiles who rape starving African children, here‚Äôs the proof he did the üëåüèª sign‚Äù

this shit is SO annoying!! i cant understand how anyone can laugh at some bland ass straight white guy being a bigot. he's not funny he's just a fucking idiot. if there are BRILLIANT comedians who don't have to rely on being edgy to be funny, pewdiepie can do the same
What if we call out Pewdiepie for all of that stuff, then call out Hbomb for all of the same stuff minus the nazism, plus being a pompous little bitch? https://t.co/8LAHmgcu54
It hasn't even been a week since the attack and journalists are going out of their way to not only play into the psycho's hands, but blame Pewdiepie for something he had nothing to do with. 

And they think themselves to be good people. "Thank a journalist". No.

@dingerdanger @Sublime0126 @Flusswoelfin @EricDSnider If you watched a pewdiepie video and got white supremavist racist vibe from him then you're the problem. Thats not Felix at all. And saying things like that on the internet creates a dangerous precedent for actual violent people blaming their mistakes on innocent people. Not ok.
@JacobyIsMyName @pewdiepie I'm the farthest thing from being a fan of his, but why would people think HE is personally responsible for this tragedy? What????
@Bonzane1 @V8W2Y2 @James_Elmquist @YouTube @pewdiepie (6)
And that kind of behavior is unacceptable and rightfully so.
The "subscribe to PewDiePie". Same situation. Knowing that alt-right guys in the U.S have previously tried to frame PewDiePie as their own he says it and thus make people believe PewDiePie is an alt-right guy. Stirs shit up.
it happened :( @pewdiepie https://t.co/nXswqx3GYJ
Could you imagine people who starting watching pewdiepie now being shocked that he plays games üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüíî
@xFatih @grantstern @pewdiepie Considering he casually used racist rhetoric,  seriously or not, does play a part in this, and I'm hoping this is a wake up call to him to not treat that subject matter lightly.
@L1rian @downsinjerome @Lapinsky_11 @pewdiepie Oh, was he kidding?  Hard to tell in a tweet tbh.
Pewdiepie throws his head back when he laughs. It's cute.
@YoungNubian @tariqnasheed @KingofNoStrings thats because the symbol he is doing is not racist, its the context behind it, pewdiepie did that ok symbol as a reaction for people to meme or use as a reaction to something that was good, he also did this finger wagging one, is he racist is this also becomes a wp gesture? https://t.co/WKrLLoDaLb

@Lapinsky_11 @pewdiepie He misquoted/-used the article. That part of the article was about the hacking. Hacking in itself is not illegal but can easily be used as an illegal tool, that's why him endorsing hacking is interpretable as condoning extreme activity and was likely a fuel to these vandalizers.

@JViscoNJ @jkass99 why do Nazis write "Subscribe to PewdiePie" on Holocaust Memorials?

Can you explain why that happens? If it happens so often, so repeatedly, is it random? 

People know it's not random
@ahlatkhan9 the police were just memeing. And the shooter was a memer it seems as well as he mentioned pewdiepie and did the symbol. That man deserves to burn in hell
@pewdiepie im a New Zealander and was very close to where the attack happened, this is not something we even thought could happen in NZ, we are so disturbed. NZ is such a welcoming country to every culture..regardless we do not blame you Felix. This is not your fault. The terrorist is sick!
I've never watched a spankiev or PewDiePie video before strangely
Two things I want to address. Get over it the shooter wanted to give pewdiepie a bad image. Second of all care more about the victims and family from the tradedgy #PewdiepieDidNothingWrong
@GossiTheDog I ONLY commented on the "not always said in hate"...which I told you to hop online. Pewdiepie said something horrible (not to the person btw) but to his stream. Said he was sorry and erases the video. I never said why he said it. I don't know. YOU DON'T KNOW.
I wonder how many of Pewdiepie‚Äôs subscribers are dead
Fun video (with @pewdiepie, @atmosgames) and a cool game! I popped into some of the development streams, but never saw the full thing until now. Great work @atmosgames (in such a short time, too)! :)

Why people hating on PewDiePie. His haters come out from caves for any hit he gets.
@DaxOrien @MavrelousMavrel @Undoomed @pewdiepie I never said it fell flat on me
@pewdiepie We know you had NOTHING to do with his horrible actions. Im sickened that people are using this as an excuse to further their own agenda against you. Those who blame you, they are absolutely delusional/selfish. Our hearts go out to those who were effected during this tragic event
qwhite inch resting how the defense of pewdiepie is stronger &amp; more vehement than any other emotion or position a lot of people have ever held in their entire lives

@swag72410360 @lil_wurst Holy shit how can these people be so dumb. HOW THE HELL WAS PEWDIEPIE RESPNSIBLE FOR THIS?!?!?!
Read the comments in that post and dont even try to tell me that SJW's arent a problem and arent a detriment to society.

They mention killing Pewdiepie... For following people they disagree with..
@Diehard45C @Rlp1660Rick @BetoORourke @RepBetoORourke Robert is trying to compete with PewdiePie for  followers and subs....
@realDailyWire @benshapiro @DrPhil Ben Shapiro hosted meme review. Dr. Phil will be hosting The Daily Wire. @DrPhil let @pewdiepie host Dr. Phil to complete the trifecta.
Zero Death, Pewdiepie game! https://t.co/5yFU4rRjga https://t.co/g6QhFftHOg
@DipeshS75000072 @subzy91 @pewdiepie He was talking about how ridiculous it is to bar Pakistani talent from having a place on their platform because of the actions of a terrorist. https://t.co/rXASLBy70N
The shooting was bad enough but now people are using it to blame the victims, push their far right or left bullshit, blame uninvolved people like pewdiepie, and push conspiracy theories like false flag...

Gross. The whole thing is just gross.
Everyone go download Zero Deaths by @atmosgames Its a game about @pewdiepie and it features @benshapiro https://t.co/WG3wp9ldRh
If you were still wondering though, the Bernie/Corbyn bros have spent more time attacking and blaming Chelsea Clinton and Laurie Penny for what happened in New Zealand than Pewdiepie or Candace Owens.  You know people actually brought up by the shooter himself.  #Berniebros
@pewdiepie Ive donated and ive spread the word of this campaign, love the amount you care pewds, no matter what the media says you always show compassion for those in need https://t.co/euNZQk9CKn
@JViscoNJ @jkass99 why do Nazis write "Subscribe to PewdiePie" on Holocaust Memorials?

Can you explain why that happens? If it happens so often, so repeatedly, is it random? 

People know it's not random
@ahlatkhan9 the police were just memeing. And the shooter was a memer it seems as well as he mentioned pewdiepie and did the symbol. That man deserves to burn in hell
@pewdiepie im a New Zealander and was very close to where the attack happened, this is not something we even thought could happen in NZ, we are so disturbed. NZ is such a welcoming country to every culture..regardless we do not blame you Felix. This is not your fault. The terrorist is sick!
I've never watched a spankiev or PewDiePie video before strangely
Two things I want to address. Get over it the shooter wanted to give pewdiepie a bad image. Second of all care more about the victims and family from the tradedgy #PewdiepieDidNothingWrong
@GossiTheDog I ONLY commented on the "not always said in hate"...which I told you to hop online. Pewdiepie said something horrible (not to the person btw) but to his stream. Said he was sorry and erases the video. I never said why he said it. I don't know. YOU DON'T KNOW.
I wonder how many of Pewdiepie‚Äôs subscribers are dead
Fun video (with @pewdiepie, @atmosgames) and a cool game! I popped into some of the development streams, but never saw the full thing until now. Great work @atmosgames (in such a short time, too)! :)

@Kitt_Aunne A white nationalist livestreamed himself shooting up a mosque and shouted "subscribe to PewDiePie" right before the shooting started.
Yo fuck pewdiepie vs t-series, French YouTube has a better title race going lol https://t.co/MKvbaZIVUy
@6Inch_ @niggagalholland @adamscliq I actually don't. I just don't want reality to become the boy who cried wolf. Especially since I live in a country where NMR exist, that you'd compare PewDiePie to actual terrorists is sickening to me and an insult to those who are actually affected by Nazis
@Supergoodpixel The post you replied to is about PewDiePie, a white man who follows alt right white supremacy people on Twitter, calling somebody a ‚Äúfucking nigger‚Äù and it being seen as ‚Äúnot hateful‚Äù.
@inktitan @jkass99 @IwriteOK Why do Nazis write "Subscribe to PewdiePie" on Holocaust Memorials??????????????
All of them say ‚ÄúSub 2 Pewdiepie‚Äù. https://t.co/LCprbPYkyr
Imagine blaming someone for something so horrible because they use the ‚Äúok‚Äù hand gesture. Apparently if you have ever said or done the ‚ÄúüëåüèΩ‚Äù you are a white supremist. Pewdiepie had NOTHING to do with this horrible attack, stop. https://t.co/ss2dL4VxRf

@ThatDivaTracy Many of his &lt;300 total tweets (at the moment) are from this weekend defending #PewDiePie. But I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs not a sleeper sockpuppet or anything.
@Punishednermin1 No disagreement here. It‚Äôs important to differentiate between people like PewDiePie and Moly. It‚Äôs also possible to call out someone‚Äôs rhetoric without going full on ‚Äúthis is your fault‚Äù. Nuance is key here.

I swear to fuck if someone asks me to subscribe to PewDiePie ONE MORE TIME I will singlehandedly grab  eggs, chocolate milk and a bike chain so I can fend off his 9 year old Fascist army myself
My heart is forever with both the victims' families and @pewdiepie. That day, not only were innocent lives lost, but 51 worlds crumbled apart. I will never get over this tragedy.

@pewdiepie meow https://t.co/0ojSbOTGKl
@minhyunho @joonieseunhasoo Sorry sis but this AIN'T IT. Pewdiepie has ZERO (0) control over that terrorist's actions, that scum on earth probably only did it to cause more havoc and controversy.
@pewdiepie Congrats, Pewds! I hope it won't feel weird when you hit the 100 mil milestone üòé
It's kinda weird that the people I know irl who watch pewdiepie are alt-right racist trolls.

And then the NZ shooter shouts him out.
@pewdiepie Pewds, I just wanna say I'm sorry obnoxious activists have forced your hand in unfollowing all but one account. It's a scary world we live in where people aren't allowed to have their own opinions without being raked over the coals.
@glossyjoona @boiledpotatoToe @BTSRuinLives @pewdiepie no actually he likes bts and he made a video about it telling how good they are. he still likes them and bc of that his editor made him tweet it and they were just joking. 
and he said that he actually doesnt care about tseries passing him MANY times.

@pewdiepie Thanks to you for 90 million smiles‚ù§Ô∏è https://t.co/fDB0UdaWCK
Some ARMYs are pressed that PewDiePie reuploaded a picture of jimin and changed his bio for bts. He isn‚Äôt doing this for clout, understand that. If you actually watched his videos you would know that the whole fight against T-Series is a joke. He actually said in a couple of -

oh so normies are talking about bts just bc pewdiepie had an unfollow spree and unfollowed everyone but bts lol i mean bts stands for Beat T Series after all

@pewdiepie Guys don‚Äôt fall in this trap, he‚Äôs using us for followers and he doesn‚Äôt actually give a care in the world about BTS üò≠
PewDiePie choosing who to unfollow on Twitter is like one of those CAPTCHA tests where you have to click every box that contains a picture of a bus, only instead of a bus, it's a Nazi, and he failed the CAPTCHA test so many times that he panicked and clicked every box.
